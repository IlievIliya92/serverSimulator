Write a C program to simulate a server with two client observers

Expectation is to have one process running on Linux as a producer and two processes working as consumers.

You can use any type of IPC communication mechanism as long as you fit in the time frame.

Expected output:


| Server Es                      | Client 1                    | Client 2
|“Unit 1” produced               | N/A                         | N/A
|                                | Client 1 started            | N/A
| Client 1 connected             |                             |
| “Unit 2” produced              |Server Es produced “Unit 2”  | N/A
|                                |                             | Client 2 started
| Client 2 connected             |                             |
| “Unit 3” produced              |                             |
|                                | Server Es produced “Unit 3” | Server Es produced “Unit 3”
| Client 1 message receive Ack   |                             |
| Client 2 message receive Ack   |                             |


Bonus points: To implement a library that can be linked against both clients in order to handle the Inter Process Communication
